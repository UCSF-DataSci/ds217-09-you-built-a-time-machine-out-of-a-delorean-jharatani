 Timezone Operations Report
TODO: Document your timezone operations:
 The original data was naive (no timezone info).
 I localized the data to UTC using tz_localize('UTC').
 I converted the data to 'US/Eastern' timezone.
    Some issues with DST transitions were avoided by using UTC as the base timezone, which has no daylight saving time. 
    This prevents ambiguity during the transition periods when clocks are set forward or backward.
One example is the datetime '2023-03-12 10:00:00' in UTC, which converts to '2023-03-12 05:00:00' in US/Eastern.
UTC is recommended because it is consistent year-round without DST changes, 
reducing complexity in time calculations and comparisons across different regions.
